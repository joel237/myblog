I love Git:
i had the course of Git Hub when i was in engeneering school (like 20 year ago).
and when i was finally ready to share my knowledge it stroke me that Git Hub was the best tool to really work with me on my project.
The system of control version it adapt to the way users want to work on the same project in millions of miles away from each other 
so i really recommend to use it if you have a control system version ;-)
